I call this one the disappearing tongue
Some nights is off, some nights is on
When it goes with a twist, it comes off
Put it in a vase and pass it on
Sitting vacant on plough lane
Sitting vacant
Sitting lame
Sitting on plough lane
Pull out feathers, tear off cellophane
Yeah, sure, I'll leave the house
But first let me lose a few more pounds
If only I could be 3 stone 20 pounds, oh
Are 10 kilograms enough?
PVC drips across the street
And everybody clamours upon their knees
But I have no interest, I am indifferent
I do not care, I have no interest
She moves with a purpose
And what a magnificent purpose
Oh, what a purpose
Oh, what a magnificent purpose
They find different ways to suck themselves off
She does not care at all
It is oh, such a purpose, it is such a purpose
It is so, what a magnificent purpose
Move with a purpose
Such a purpose
It is such a purpose
It is such a magnificent purpose
It is so magnificent
She moves with such a purpose
It is a magnificent purpose
It is, a magnificent
Purpose
She still moves with a purpose
Moves with a purpose
She moves with a purpose
And it is such a purpose
Move with a purpose
It is such a purpose
It is so magnificent
It is such a magnificent purpose
And it is so
And she moves with a purpose
With a purpose, it is so magnificent
So magnificent
So so so so so so so so so so so magnificent
It is such a magnificent purpose
Pur-pur-pur-pur-pur-purpose
She moves with a purpose
And what a magnificent purpose
And she moves with a purpose
And ah, so magnificent
Ah, so magnificent
From now on I will be like this all of the time
Though I have said that so many times
I was under his scrutiny, but oh, he failed to break me
He laid out his theories, every one that he got
He tried his best to stay strong, and resilient
He does not view things as they are
But he views them as they fit into his plan
He looks prophetic as he theorises my demise
But he is pathetic and he is nothing more
But he could not break me
He could never break me
He could not break me
He looks so distraught as all his efforts amount to nothing
I sit back and watch his 69 mind in full effect
Every quote just eats itself with a different perspective
He recycles points with a different tone of voice
From a lack of any reaction he begins to become complacent
I have the upper hand, now all I need to do is speak
I say, "Diagnose if you wish but please first take your hands off your dick
Diagnose if you wish but please first take your hands off your dick"
He could not
He would not
He could not break me
He could never break me
He could never
Please stop all of this
Strange fantasy
This is not who you are
Not who you want to be
Not who I want you to be
You were once so kind
Please remove these thoughts
Remove them from your mind
For they are a disgrace
To yourself and your family
If not, I'll have to make
So self-righteous
Do not lie
What a contradiction
An eye for an eye
But you are just too lazy
It is purely fantasy
And it takes so quick
Everyone joins in
And it is condemned
It is a sin, it is a sin
New city
Old buildings
Build this ground
On floodplain
Near needly water
And dogshit park
New city
Old buildings
Council going
Missing tonight
To live next to
Live next to the game
New flats
New ground
Honey, we won't build to this code
Honey, we won’t build it
Honey, we won't, we won’t, we won't
Honey, we won't build to this code
Honey, we won't build it
Honey, we won't build
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won’t
Stock car racing
Speedway
Old greyhounds
New old ground
This new city
This new town
This new sound
This new ground
And old gripes
Cup ties
Turnstiles
Don’t sit right
Up here
Up here
Up here
Up here, up here, up here
It may be sweet
And it may be poor
And it may be back
And it may be forward
And it may be done
And it may be sick
And it may be sweet
And it may be
It may be new
And it may be cross
And it may be sweat
And it may be woe
And it may be hard
And it may be dark
And it may be mould
And it may be back
And it may be old
And it may be done
And it may be hard
And it may be soon
And it may be tongue
But as long as I keep an hourglass, everything's in line
Maybe it's an hourglass, everything in line
But I wish I could be as elegant as Soo
The way he comes in through a room in a way I cannot do
He's got a coat of nine tails and fresh leather shoes
Straight from the cow, I tell you
Straight from the cow
But my shirt is so un-ironed it could be a mountain range
My shoes, the rotting flesh of a mange
My shirt is so un-ironed it could be a mountain range
And I have no name to the skin folds near who show no face
But all I can hear as they gawk and they gurn and they scream and they laugh
I must make a new plan if I hope to ever last
And it may be
It may be
And it may be
And it may be hard
It may be hard
And it may be hard
It may be hard, it may be hard, it may be, may be, may be
As long as I keep
As long as I keep
As long as I keep everything will fall into line
He sleeps alone
He drinks alone
Outside
His home
They're loving the water, they breathe in the water
They fight in the water, they're fixing the water
What's in the water? Here in the water
And I see you hide
I'm alive and I can see
The water is foul and it's hard to breathe
There's lead in the water, there's lead in the water
There's lead in the water and you think that I'm fine
I'm stained by the water and only the water
I'm drained by the water, are you losing your mind?
Dead in the water, dead in the water
At a center
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
Monday morning, commotion throughout
Reverberations of a bell's sound
A sweetheart calls and I venture forth
A voice so fair, I had no thought
And preaching on the pros of naval aviation
Ha n'a n'a n an n'a n'a hee n'a
I'm so enthralled by this grand affair
So I choose to be one with the scum of this air
Nought is true
So unclean
And it smells so bad
Looked so grand
The thing left at one o'clock
But no, It is awful
And sweat is running down
No, it is awful
And the silesfunder he, hem l n’a n’a n’a neeeeeeeeeeeeee!
But I dream of a woman with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
Oh yes, a sweetheart with the teeth of a raven and the feet of a shrimp and the legs of a--
Scrap poff puff poff bluah bla
Scre poff pef a hé n'a ne ne ne n'a o!
[unintelligible screams]
And the sweat is running down my face, I wish it could be cold
So I could get a bottle full of it and sell it to the old
Their leather cannot handle heat and cracks repulsively
I'd sell to soothe my eyesight, not because they have the need
And he said, "Come here sweetheart, give me a kiss"
With the thoughts of a sister he so dearly missed
Now I understand the reason and feel to comply
I said, "But please, first you must understand the reason why
Is because that I dream of a woman with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
And she'd be so sweet, she'd be so nice, and she'd be all of mine
Oh yes, a sweetheart with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
She'd be so sweet, yes, she'd be so nice, she'd be all of mine"
We'd wake before daylight
Practice up until noon
He wanted perfection
Always the same tune
After all the shitty things you'd done for me
I left you in a ditch
You were the bank but I was the star on the silver screen
My cheeks made blind men see and they all rose for me
But after all the pretty things you'd done for me
I left you in a ditch
My voice grew hoarse reciting words that you know so well
Though no one heard, they would so soon
Once my sound was known to the finest tastes that set global tone
"And I'll helm the seas of a burgeoning scene as the new-come queen
While you lick your wounds in a hole that's black perpetually"
A pink caterpillar with six anorexic children let me stay
But I had to keep moving through anteater town
After anteater town after anteater town after anteater town after anteater town
I'd spent all your cash by the time I got to Schlagenheim
And your name was gouged, it was no use
To think that you could play
But despite all the stupid plans you set for me
You're still in that ditch
And I was led here after some talk of atmospheres
I skipped the line, made it known that I was one to see
The desk was pain, said I did not fit
No time for ploys and games, I made my way
Through flocks of imbeciles, I crawled through my entry point
But the curtain drew, I was too late
In a white suit stuffed with hay, you were on stage
You were on stage, you were on stage, you were on stage
Lights came dim and hands came one
Though not for me
He sat and began the sound
It sang the chords of my memory, implying that tune
Years ago they tried to
Put me in a
Years ago they tried to throw me in a payphone
All I made was a penny and a black eye, ba-ba-ba
A pen and a black swan came and took my
Years ago they tried to cut me with a chainsaw
All I had was pen and a crayon, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
I drowned my own son in a cold river
Jammed my head in a generator, ba-ba-ba
Do do widzenia proszę
Dja dja dja dja dja Dziękuję
Do do do widzenia
Dja dja dja dja dja Dziękuję
I met a blind man the other day
As I crossed the street in my hometown
He came up to me
His eyes all glazed over
His hair slicked back behind his ears
And he said to me
"Son,"
"Son, it's a dangerous world out there"
And "Don't worry, but if you're not careful you'll hurt yourself"
I said, "Alright sir, I'll do my best, thank you very much."
And I carried on crossing
And when I finally reached the other side I went into 7-Eleven
I got today's New York Times and a single cigarette
I also asked them to do me an omelette
But they ran out of eggs
So I bought my things and left the store
With my paper
Lit a cigarette
Flipped to the back pages of the paper to read the sports news
Not much to read
So I got to the curb and got out my keys
The RV was just on the other side
I began to cross
I pushed the button to unlock it
And as I reached for the door
A great big fuckoff truck went straight through me
